You are a senior brand-focused frontend developer.

TASK:
Correct and refine the website design so the Kandle Digital logo is placed precisely,
scaled correctly, and visually harmonized with the website background.
The entire website must strictly follow the logo’s color palette.

DO NOT redesign the whole website.
ONLY fix logo usage, background harmony, and color consistency.

––––––––––––––––
1. LOGO ADJUSTMENT (CRITICAL)
––––––––––––––––
- Place the Kandle Digital logo at the TOP-LEFT of the navigation bar
- Logo must be vertically centered within the navbar
- Logo height: 36–40px (desktop), 32px (mobile)
- Maintain clear padding around the logo (minimum 16px)
- DO NOT crop, recolor, stretch, or add backgrounds to the logo
- Logo must sit on a SOLID background that complements it

NAVBAR BACKGROUND:
- Use Off-White: #F9FAFB
- Add a subtle bottom border: #E5E7EB
- Ensure logo colors are clearly visible and not washed out

––––––––––––––––
2. LOGO + WEBSITE BACKGROUND HARMONY
––––––––––––––––
- The logo must never sit on pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Use Off-White (#F9FAFB) for light sections
- Use Deep Navy (#0F172A) only for large hero or footer sections
- Avoid placing the logo on dark backgrounds unless an inverted logo version exists

––––––––––––––––
3. STRICT COLOR PALETTE (NO EXCEPTIONS)
––––––––––––––––
Use ONLY the following colors across the entire website:

- Deep Navy (Primary): #0F172A
- Brand Blue: #1E40AF
- Brand Teal: #14B8A6
- Warm Amber (Primary CTA): #F59E0B
- Soft Orange (Hover / Accent): #FB923C
- Off White (Background): #F9FAFB
- Cool Gray (Body Text): #475569

DO NOT:
- Introduce new colors
- Use random grays or blacks
- Use gradients outside of logo-inspired accents only

––––––––––––––––
4. HERO SECTION COLOR FIX
––––––––––––––––
- Background: Off-White (#F9FAFB)
- “Less Noise.” → Deep Navy (#0F172A)
- “More Results.” → Warm Amber (#F59E0B)
- Body text → Cool Gray (#475569)

CTA BUTTON:
- Background: Warm Amber (#F59E0B)
- Text: Deep Navy (#0F172A)
- Hover: Soft Orange (#FB923C)

––––––––––––––––
5. CONSISTENCY RULES
––––––––––––––––
- Navigation links → Deep Navy

- Icons → Brand Teal or Brand Blue
- Borders & dividers → light neutral gray only

––––––––––––––––
6. TECH REQUIREMENTS
