You are a senior brand-focused web designer and frontend developer.

Redesign the KandleDigital.com website so it does NOT look like a generic AI SaaS template.

GOALS:
- Feel handcrafted, bold, and human
- Reflect a Kenyan-based digital marketing agency with global standards
- Avoid stock “dashboard laptop” hero images
- No floating stat cards, no generic gradients, no AI clichés

BRAND IDENTITY:
- Brand name: KandleDigital
- Industry: Digital Marketing Agency
- Target: Kenyan SMEs, startups, and growing brands
- Tone: Confident, results-driven, trustworthy, local but premium

DESIGN DIRECTION:
- Editorial-style layout (like modern agencies & magazines)
- Strong typography hierarchy
- More white space, fewer gimmicks
- Subtle motion only (fade, slide, underline)
- Custom sections instead of cards everywhere

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Deep Navy / Charcoal
- Accent: Warm Orange or Amber (representing “Kandle” / growth)
- Secondary: Soft Sand / Light Grey
- Text: Near-black, not pure black

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Headings: Bold, modern sans-serif (large, confident)
- Body: Clean readable font
- Use oversized headlines and broken lines for uniqueness

HERO SECTION (VERY IMPORTANT):
- NO stock dashboards
- NO AI-style badges like “ROI Focus” or floating bubbles

Instead:
- Left: Big bold headline with personality
  Example:
  “We Don’t Run Ads.
   We Build Revenue Systems.”

- Right: Realistic agency-style visual:
  - abstract shapes
  - brand typography
  - or real-world business imagery (team, workspace, campaign planning)

- CTA buttons:
  [Get a Growth Plan] (primary)
  [See Our Work] (secondary)

ABOUT SECTION:
- Short story-style paragraph
- Why KandleDigital exists
- Focus on clarity, not buzzwords

SERVICES SECTION:
- Minimal grid
- No icons overload
- Services:
  - SEO & Local Search (Google Business)
  - Paid Ads (Google & Social)
  - Social Media Setup & Strategy
  - Website & Funnel Design
- Each service has 1 sentence outcome-based description

SOCIAL PROOF:
- Use realistic metrics
- Example:
  “Trusted by growing businesses across Kenya”
- Simple testimonials layout (text-based, no cards)

LOCAL TRUST:
- Mention Kenya, Nairobi, Mombasa subtly
- MPESA-friendly businesses
- SMEs focus

FOOTER:
- Clean, minimal
- Contact CTA
- WhatsApp & Email emphasis

TECH REQUIREMENTS:
- Use React + Tailwind
- Mobile-first
- Clean semantic HTML
- No placeholder lorem ipsum
- Write real copy, not AI buzzwords

FINAL OUTPUT:
- A full homepage component
- Production-ready
- Looks like a custom agency site, not an AI template
